# SOFT-TEACHER_mmdetection-
TRAINING SOFT TEACHER USING MMDETECTION

Hey all, </br>
when I was in my intern period at IIT Bombay, I was given a task to work with soft teacher using MMdetection.</t> When I went through the official repo, i found that there wasnt a proper tutorial as to how to train semi-supervised algorithm such as soft teacher. <br>
So i decided to provide a colab file of my own and also the steps as to how to train them on a custom dataset, Here I will using Kitti dataset from the official dstaset website. <br>

the official github repo to clone is  "https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection"

<br>
I have attached a Word document, which contains detailed steps and why. Have fun.

you will require lots of GPU and storage, so make sure everything's ready.
